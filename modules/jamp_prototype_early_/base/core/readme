Prototype project for jamp (json actor message protocol)
See: http://hessian.caucho.com/jamp/index.xtp

WebSocket JavaScript API is described here http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/
http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/start-using-html5-websockets-today/



Project Goal: 

   Make calls from HTML 5.0 web application to JAMP websocket tier. DONE!
   It works. 


Status: 

  Current Status:
      Issue FIXED JSONDecoder is String/character array based, it should be Reader based.
      

   Old Status:
      Issue FIXED JSONEncoder now properly encodes unicode /uXXX, tabs, formfeeds and more (it does 2 out of 9 which is fine for a prototype).
      This can be summed up as follows:

        Encoder encoder = new JSONEncoder();
        Decoder decoder = new JSONDecoder();
      
        String str = "ßæçîñking bad~\u007f\u0080~"; //Range checking 007f end of ascii and 0080 start of unicode
        assertEquals("\"\\u00DF\\u00E6\\u00E7\\u00EE\\u00F1king bad~\u007f\\u0080~\"", encoder.encodeObject(str));        
        assertEquals(str, decoder.decodeObject(encoder.encodeObject(str)));
        
      Note:  
      Made JSON encoding ASCII to unicode safe /u007E to //u0080 to be exact, 
      decoder does not care if it is utf 8 or utf 16 or utf whatever.
      Encoding assumes ASCII as per discussion here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/583562/json-character-encoding. 
      This is inline with other JSON libraries.
      
   Old Status:
      Wrote simple JavaScript/HTML 5 client for WebSocket and it works.
      (Found problem with websocket. It was a typo in the JavaScript. I hate JavaScript. No warning or error. Just did not work.)


   Older Status:
     Wrote simple JavaScript/HTML 5 client for Ajax and it works
     Wrote WebSocket client, and WebSocket Listeners in Java. The listeners in Java handle the message fine, but it does not seem to send back the message very well.
     I am getting WebSocket messages to Java handlers, but they are not able to send text back yet.


   Older Status:
     2nd Early prototype working.
     Prototype sent AMP message from HTTP request to Servlet.
     I have enough where I can start writing the HTML 5 client. 
     New class added HttpMessageSender (MessageSender).
     Also created JampServlet which uses a ServiceInvoker and the new JampMessageReaderDecoder.
     It works round trip. Just implemented void calls, i.e., jamp send.

   Older still Status:
     1st early prototype working. 
     Prototype sends method calls to file system via JampFileSenderMain.

   Client role of prototype:
      JampFileSenderMain uses AmpProxyCreator passing AmpProxyCreator and interface and a MessageSender.
      FileMessageSender just writes method calls as binary or text files to the file system.
      AmpProxyCreator is responsible for encoding the method calls into JAMP or HAMP messages via a MethodEncoder (JampMethodEncoder or HampMethodEncoder).
      
      AmpProxyCreator uses simple reflection.
      
      In the example,  AmpProxyCreator creates a proxy EmployeeService. Calls to employeeService.addEmployee() equate to JSON files being written
      to a directory.
   
      To change how the message gets sent replace FileMessageSender with WebSocketMessageSender, RESTMessageSender or STOMPMessageSender.


   Server role of the prototype:
      JampFileProcessorMain reads JSON files from a directory that contain JAMP messages.
      JampFileProcessorMain uses a ServiceInvoker to invoke a method on an actual service.
      ServiceInvoker gets bound to EmployeeServiceImpl.
      JampFileProcessorMain invokes serviceInvoker.invokeMessage(payload) passing it the raw payload (String containing JAMP/JSON message).
      ServiceInvoker uses two decoders to decode the Message, namely, JampMessageDecoder and JSONDecoder.
      JampMessageDecoder is used to quickly decode the payload into a Message object (representing the fields of a JAMP message).
      Then JSONDecoder is used to parse the message argument list.
      
      JSONDecoder decodes the incoming objects from the argument list into String, Integer, Double, booleans, Maps (JSON object), 
      and Lists (JSON arrays), BUT no user classes. This can be an entire nested hierarchy as JSONDecoder is a recursive descent parser
      that handles JSON syntax fairly well.
      
      ServiceInvoker finds the correct method to call on the service (method name and number of arguments must match).
      ServiceInvoker then coerces the entire argument list (hierarchy) into Java equivalents. It converts JSON Objects (Java Map at this point)
      into Java classes. It copies over properties from map entries. Again it does this recursively.
      ServiceInvoker then invokes the method passing it the arguments.
      
      
      Note: ServiceInvoker uses type information from the argument list as the authority on final conversion and coercion.
      ServiceInvoker also coerces and converts from Integer, Double, Boolean (JSON types)
      into int, short, long, double, float, byte, Integer, Short, Long, Double, Float, Byte, boolean, Boolean. 
      The idea from Scott is that JSON payload does not need type information as methods arguments is the metadata source.
      
 Caveats:
    This is prototype code. There is no logging, code conventions, etc.
    Also this code (at this point), does not depend on anything outside of the Java SE.
    It does not use any Cacuho classes or any library.
    
    
 Known limitations (and TODO list):

     JampServlet not generic. It could and should be.
     JampListener (implements WebSocketListener) not generic either.
     WebSocketMessageSender, STOMPMessageSender are not implemented.
     JSONStringDecoder decodes all escape characters specified in JSON but does not handle null, +NAN, -NAN  
             (minor oversights which may be okay for prototype).
     JavaDocs mostly missing.
     Resin coding style, mostly ignored for now, which may be ok if this is published tutorial/cookbook as it uses more common { placements.
     ServiceInvoker does not handle List (not needed for first prototype, may be ok to leave out of prototype tutorial, easy to add).
     Code quality prototype mode (error checking minimal, no logging, etc.)
     Unit tesitng (not TDD, more like, just enough to feel confident that things are working) not robust

     
     
  Next steps: 
      HTML 5 client, Jamp Resin Web Socket Handler (WebSocketListener see http://caucho.com/resin-4.0/examples/websocket-java/)
