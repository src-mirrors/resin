This is the README file for Resin 3.0(tm)
=========================================

The documentation included with Resin is in XTP format starting at
resin-doc/index.xtp.

XTP assumes you've already got Resin working, so you should read this
README up to part III: Getting Started.  The full documentation is also
available online at http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.0 if you
have trouble getting started.

Questions should go to our mailing list.  To subscribe, send a mail to 
resin-interest-request@caucho.com with the body "subscribe".

You can also send us your bug reports to bugs@caucho.com


I) Licensing
------------

For pricing and licensing information for Resin 3.0 Professional,
see http://www.caucho.com/sales/.  Resin Professional contains additional
performance and reliability features beyond the Resin Open Source version.

Resin 3.0 Open Source is released under the GPL.

II) Preconditions
-----------------

1) Resin needs a Java JDK before it can run.  Resin 3.0 works with 
JDK 1.4 or greater.  You need the JDK, not the JRE because Resin needs the
Java compiler.  We recommend using IBM's jikes compiler.

Some locations for JDKs include:

  http://java.sun.com      -- Sun's site
  http://www.ibm.com       -- IBM's JDKs.

2) On Unix, Resin's wrapper.pl script expects Perl 5.

3) On Windows, you'll need an unzip tool available at http://www.winzip.com


III) Getting Started
--------------------

Start your Resin evaluation with Resin's included httpd server
even if you plan to use Resin with another web server.

The included HTTP/1.1 server makes it easy to evaluate Resin, JSP
and servlets.  Just start it up.  The default configuration
files can be used without modification.

1) On Unix, you'll want to build the JNI libraries:

   resin-3.0.x> ./configure
   resin-3.0.x> make
   resin-3.0.x> make install

2) To start the server:

     unix> resin-3.0/bin/httpd.sh

   or

     c:\> resin-3.0/httpd

   The server listens to port 8080.

3) Usually, Resin can find the JDK, but you may need to set JAVA_HOME in some
   configurations.  You can also specify the JDK on the command line:

   unix> resin-3.0.x/bin/httpd.sh -java_home /usr/java

   Starting Resin with -verbose is a great way to see what environment
   Resin is running.

4) Browse http://localhost:8080 or equivalently http://127.0.0.1:8080.

5) Go through the documentation at http://localhost:8080/resin-doc

6) For JSP, create test.jsp in resin-3.0.x/webapps/ROOT/test.jsp and browse
   http://localhost:8080/test.jsp.

   Resin serves files from resin-3.0.x/webapps/ROOT/ in the default
   configuration.  All files with the extension '.jsp' are interpreted
   as jsp files.

7) For Servlets, create
   resin-3.0/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/HelloServlet.java
   and browse http://localhost:8080/servlet/HelloServlet

   Resin automatically compiles Java classes in WEB-INF/classes.  
   Add the servlet source in WEB-INF/classes and browse.


IV) Plugin Configuration (unix)
-------------------------------

To install for Apache, you'll need to compile the plugin with:

  configure --with-apache=/usr/local/apache
  make
  make install

Full details are in resin-doc/install 
(or online at http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.0/install/).


V) Plugin Configuration (windows)
---------------------------------

To install Resin with IIS or Apache, use

  c:\> resin-3.0.x\setup

Full details are in the Installation section of the documentation.
