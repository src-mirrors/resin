(thanks to E Hauser)
</p>

<p>
Here's how I debug Resin with Eclipse.  I launch the Resin start script
with the arguments:
</p>

<example>
-Xdebug -Xnoagent
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=12345
</example>

<p>
Then in Eclipse, go to Run -&gt; Debug -&gt; Remote Application.  Click new
and make sure the project is set to the application you want to debug.
Connection type should be "Standard (Socket Attach)", and your
connection host should be "localhost" with the port "12345".
</p>

<p>
You can launch Resin internally from Eclipse by launching the main Resin
class with the correct parameters, but socket attach has always worked
fine for me.

        <p>Arnaud Peyre has developed a comprehensive <a href="external|resinforeclipse|index">Resin plugin for
        Eclipse.</a></p>

        <p>
<b>Resin For Eclipse plugin provides tools for developing web projects: </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Resin management :</b> a graphical user interface for
	managing Resin servers within Eclipse. The interface allows
	you to create servers, add web projects, edit classpath and
	system properties, manage https, launch, debug and stop the
	server. It should work with web projects created by any other
	plugin (such as WSAD ones).</li>

	<li><b>Web projects :</b> the plugin allows you to create
	generic web projects (you don't need to install Resin) or
	projects optimized for Resin. Web projects include
	autodetection of jar files added to the
	"WEB-INF/lib" directory.</li>

	<li><b>War exporation :</b> a wizard to export web projects
	into war files.</li>

</ul>
