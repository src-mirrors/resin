<p>Struts is very commonly used with Resin, and should work
fine.</p>

<s1 title="Java Web Services Developer Pack (JWSDP) 1.1">
<p>(rep by Tony)</p>

<p>We've downloaded the Sun jwsdp1.1.</p>

<p>When we now want to run it in Resin, we receive a CompilingClassloader error
on com.sun.xml.rpc.server.http.JAXRPCContextListener
The reason is that in this class, sun casts to a "URLClassloader", but the Resin
engine is just a base "ClassLoader".
If we change this class (line 52 and 72) from sun to cast not longer to
UrlClassLoader but to ClassLoader,
everything works and the jaxrpc webservices work fine on
Resin!</p>


<p>This is not a bug in Resin, but I think it is useful to report it to put it
as a FAQ on your website and report it to sun . In this way the
webservices work fine on caucho!</p>
