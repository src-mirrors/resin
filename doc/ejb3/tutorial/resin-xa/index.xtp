    <title>Transaction Method Annotations</title>
        <description>
          <p>Transaction annotations make reliable database updates
clear, straightforward and scalable. Transaction boundaries protect
database consistency by enforcing an all-or-none policy and using
the database's locking capabilities for scalability.</p>

<section title="Transactions">

<p>Transactions are the common interface to a database's locking
capability used to ensure consistent database updates.  Because
transactional applications use centralized database locking instead of
application-specific synchronized blocks they scale to
multi-jvm and multi-server deployments without modification.</p>

<p>The tutorial uses transactions to swap teachers for two courses safely.
To maintain consistency, either the swap
must complete or the database must remain unchanged.  Transactions avoid
the inconsistent state.  The example's database has a single entity, Course.
Each course has a course name and an assigned teacher.</p>

<section title="JDBC commit - underlying database support">

<p>The JDBC <code>commit()</code> is the foundation for transactions.  At
the core, the database provides transactions as part of its locking
strategy.  The Resin and EJB transactions are mainly programming wrappers
around the core database transactions.</p>

<example title="Basic JDBC transaction pattern">
Connection conn = ...;

conn.setAutoCommit(false);
try {
  ... // protected JDBC statements
} finally {
  conn.commit();
}
</example>

<p>When a method is marked as requiring a transaction, the enhanced method
essentially creates the above JDBC transaction pattern around the method.
Any JDBC calls inside the method are protected by the database's
transaction support, including entity bean calls.</p>

</section>

<section title="UserTransaction - generalizing from JDBC">

<p>Although the JDBC commit forms the foundation of transactions,
a more general solution is needed for transaction
boundaries: javax.transaction.UserTransaction.  Application servers
like Resin provide UserTransaction support for JDBC automatically
as part of the connection pooling capability.</p>

<p>JDBC commit is inappropriate for transaction boundaries for two reasons:
it mixes two separate concepts in one API and is restricted to JDBC.  In
particular, JDBC commit can't be directly used for persistent object
updates like EJB3 or JDO.  To use JDBC commit, the method needs the Connection
object that needs protection, but a transaction boundary does not have direct
access to the Connection. Instead of calling <code>conn.commit()</code>
directly, the transaction boundary uses
<code>UserTransaction.commit()</code> to call the
<code>conn.commit()</code> with some application server help.</p>

<example title="Basic JDBC transaction pattern">
UserTransaction uTrans = ...;

uTrans.begin();
try {
  ... // protected JDBC statements
} finally {
  uTrans.commit();
}
</example>

<p>Inside the try-finally block, the UserTransaction will automatically
call the JDBC transaction methods as necessary and will call
the <code>commit()</code> method during the <code>uTrans.commit()</code>.</p>

<p>By wrapping the connection transaction support in a UserTransaction, the
application server makes transaction control cleaner, and allows for
method enhancement of transaction boundaries.</p>

</section>

<section title="Method Enhancement - avoiding duplicate code">

<p>Because the UserTransaction pattern is the same for each
transaction boundary, it's important to write it once to avoid bugs
and clarify the code.  Now, the method is annotated as a transaction
boundary and Resin generates the transaction boundary code.</p>

<example title="Annotated transaction method">
@TransactionAttribute
private void swap(Course a, Course b)
{
  String teacher = a.getTeacher();
  a.setTeacher(b.getTeacher());
  b.setTeacher(teacher);
}
</example>

<p>Internally, Resin compiles the annotation into the standard transaction
boundary pattern.</p>

<example title="Enhanced code">
private void swap(Course a, Course b)
{
  javax.transaction.UserTransaction uTrans = ...;

  uTrans.begin();
  try {
    String teacher = a.getTeacher();
    a.setTeacher(b.getTeacher());
    b.setTeacher(teacher);
  } finally {
    uTrans.commit();
  }
}
</example>

<section title="Entity Bean">

<section title="Database Schema">

<example title="course.sql">
CREATE TABLE ejb3_xa_courses (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY auto_increment,

  course VARCHAR(250),
  teacher VARCHAR(250)
);

INSERT INTO basic_courses VALUES('Potions', 'Severus Snape');
INSERT INTO basic_courses VALUES('Transfiguration', 'Minerva McGonagall');
</example>

</section>

<section title="Course Entity Implementation">

<p>The Course is identical to
the <a href="../cmp-xa">CMP transaction bean</a>.  It uses
FIELD enhancement to define the database columns.

<example title="Course.java">
@Entity(access=FIELD)
@Table(name="ejb3_xa_courses")
public class Course {

  @Id(generate=AUTO)
  @Column(name="id")
  private int _id;

  @Basic
  @Column(name="course")
  private String _course;

  @Basic
  @Column(name="teacher")
  private String _teacher;
}
</example>

</section>
</section>

<section title="Swap Servlet">

<example title="SwapServlet.java">
import javax.ejb.EntityManager;
import javax.transaction.UserTransaction;

public class CourseServlet extends HttpServlet {
  @javax.ejb.Inject
  private EntityManager _manager;

  ...

  private void doService(PrintWriter out)
    throws Exception
  {
    CourseBean []course = new CourseBean[2];

    course[0] = (CourseBean) _manager.find("CourseBean", new Integer(1));
    course[1] = (CourseBean) _manager.find("CourseBean", new Integer(2));

    // swap the courses
    swap(course[0], course[1]);
  }

  @TransactionAttribute(REQUIRED)
  private void swap(Course a, Course b)
  {
    String teacher = a.getTeacher();
    a.setTeacher(b.getTeacher());
    b.setTeacher(teacher);
  }
}
</example>

<section title="@TransactionAttribute">

<p>The TransactionAttribute marks a method as needing bytecode enhancement
to support transactions.  The two most common transaction are
REQUIRED and SUPPORTS.  A REQUIRED method expects to modify the data
and wants to ensure the update is consistent.  A SUPPORTS method
will only read data, so it can avoid the overhead of a transaction.</p>

<example>
@TransactionAttribute(REQUIRED)
private void swap(Course a, Course b)
{
  String teacher = a.getTeacher();
  a.setTeacher(b.getTeacher());
  b.setTeacher(teacher);
}
</example>

<p>A transaction is the database equivalent of a <code>synchronized</code>
lock.  Transactions are somewhat more complicated locks because they need to
work with multiple machines and possibly multiple databases, but they're
still just sophisticated locks.  The typical transaction patterns are similar
to familiar lock patterns.</p>

<p>A REQUIRED attribute tells Resin that the method must be protected
by a transaction.  In this case, the swap needs protection from
simultaneous threads trying to swap at the same time.</p>

<p>A SUPPORTS attribute would tell Resin that the method doesn't need a
transaction, but the method should join any transaction that already exists.</p>

</section>

<section title="swap">

<p>The first swap in the tutorial switches the teachers using
a stateless session bean.</p>

<example>
// swap the courses using the transactional swap method
swap(course[0], course[1]);
</example>

<p>Because the <code>swap</code> method was marked as transaction REQUIRED,
Resin will start a transaction if none already exists.  If the method exits cleanly, Resin will commit the transaction.  If the method throws a
RuntimeException, Resin will roll the transaction back.</p>

<p>The <code>swap</code> method will throw a runtime exception if the
transaction fails to commit.  For example, the databse might detect a
deadlock and roll the transaction back.</p>

</section>

<ul>
<li>REQUIRED automatically rolls back on a RuntimeException
<li>REQUIRED joins any existing transaction.  In contrast,
UserTransaction throws an exception if called in a transaction.
</ul>

</section>

<section title="Differences with Stateless Session beans">

<p>The transaction annotation lets any Java class use the
same transaction capability previously
restricted to Session beans.  Other than working directly with
Java classes, the transaction boundaries are identical to EJB's
transaction boundaries.</p>

<p>Stateless session beans have the additional complexities of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requires interface and generated stubs.
<li>Requires JNDI lookup
<li>Pooled bean instances
</ul>

<p>Transaction annotation cuts to the core transaction boundary
problem, eliminating the often-unneeded complexity of Session beans.
Transaction-enhanced classes and methods are normal Java
classes marked with a JDK 1.5 annotation to produce a transaction boundary.
Resin provides the same transaction boundaries as Stateless session beans
for any Java class.</p>

<p>In contrast, Resin-enhanced classes are normal Java classes.
This example enhances a normal servlet to illustrate the differences.</p>

</section>

<section title="web.xml">

<p>The Resin enhancement currently needs some configuration in the web.xml.
The annotation value is configurable.  If you want a different transaction
attribute, use a different annotation name.  Resin provides
a com.caucho.transaction.Transaction attribute for applications
wishing to avoid confusion with EJB 3.0.</p>

<example>
&lt;class-loader>
  &lt;enhancer>
    &lt;method annotation="javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute">
	       type="com.caucho.transaction.enhancer.TransactionEnhancer"/>
  &lt;/enhancer>
&lt;/class-loader>
</example>
