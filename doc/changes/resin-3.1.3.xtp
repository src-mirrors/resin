<s1 title="Resin 3.1.x">

<p>Resin 3.1.x is a development branch.  New capabilities will be added
along with bug fixes for future versions of the Resin 3.1.x branch.</p>

<p>Deployments which need a Resin version with only bug fixes should
use the Resin 3.0.x branch.</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="HttpProxyServlet">

<p>Added fail-recover-time and connection load balancing for
HttpProxyServlet.</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Versioning">

<p>&lt;web-app-deploy> now supports a "versioning" attribute.  If true,
multiple .war files with version numbers will be resolved to the most
recent version, e.g. the url /foo would choose webapps/foo-1.1
over webapps/foo-1.0.</p>

<p>After deployment, old sessions will stay with the old version for a
period of time.  New sessions will migrate to the new version.  This
will simplify application version upgrades.</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Jdbc Pooling">

<p>Added max-idle-count to limit the idle connection size (default 1024).</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Admin">

<p>Added JdbcDriverMXBean with start()/stop() to allow control of
load-balanced database drivers.</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="JSF">

<p>Resin 3.1.3 introduces out JSF implementation.</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Config">

<p>Added keepalive-connection-time-max, limiting the total time
connections can live with keepalives.</p>

</s1>

<s1 title="Session Generation">

<p>Applications can now give a hint to the SessionManager about which
server should own the session.  Applications which use distributed
caches like EhCache can use this capability to improve locality.</p>

<p>The "caucho.session-server-id" attribute of the request object sets the
value.  It can either be a number (the index) or the server-id of the
target server.</p>

<example>
request.setAttribute("caucho.session-server-id", "app-a");

session = request.getSession(true);
</example>
