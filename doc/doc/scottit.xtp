    From the <a href="external|scottit|index">Scottit</a> home page:
    </p>

    <p>UsToBe is committed to the development of fast, reliable and
    flexible web applications. This is why we have chosen Resin as a
    fast, scaleable and reliable application server.While developing
    J2EE applications with Resin, we experienced the need for a tool
    to take a look at the internal behavior of Resin to tune and
    monitor our applications. After deploying an application, we also
    wanted to administrate and monitor the behavior of both Resin and
    the application itself.</p>

    <p>This is where Scottit saw the light of day, a Resin management
    and monitoring console for both developers and
    administrators.</p>
