<section title="Resin Threads">

<p>Resin will automatically allocate and free threads as the load requires.
Since the threads are pooled, Resin can reuse old threads without the
performance penalty of creating and destroying the threads.  When the
load drops, Resin will slowly decrease the number of threads in the
pool until is matches the load.</p>

<p>Most users can set <var/thread-max/> to something large (200 or
greater) and then forget about the threading.  Some ISPs dedicate a
JVM per user and have many JVMs on the same machine.  In that case, it
may make sense to reduce the <var/thread-max/> to throttle the
requests.</p>

<p>Since each servlet request gets its own thread, <var/thread-max/>
determines the maximum number of concurrent users.  So if you have a
peak of 100 users with slow modems downloading a large file, you'll
need a <var/thread-max/> of at least 100.  The number of concurrent
users is unrelated to the number of active sessions.  Unless the user
is actively downloading, he doesn't need a thread (except for "keepalives").
</p>

<section title="Keepalives">

<p>Keepalives make HTTP and srun requests more efficient.  Connecting to
a TCP server is relatively expensive.  The client and server need to
send several packets back and forth to establish the connection before
the first data can go through.  HTTP/1.1 introduced a protocol to keep
the connection open for more requests.  The srun protocol between
Resin and the web server plugin also uses keepalives.  By keeping the
connection open for following requests, Resin can improve performance.
</p>

<example title='resin.conf for thread-keepalive'>
...
&lt;thread-pool>
  &lt;thread-max>250&lt;/thread-max>
&lt;/thread-pool>
&lt;keepalive-max>500&lt;/keepalive-max>
...
</example>

<section title="Timeouts">

<p>Requests and keepalive connections can only be idle for a limited
time before Resin closes them.  Each connection has a read
timeout, <var/request-timeout/>.  If the client doesn't send a request
within the timeout, Resin will close the TCP socket.  The timeout
prevents idle clients from hogging Resin resources.</p>

<example>
...
&lt;thread-max>250&lt;/thread-max>
&lt;thread-keepalive>150&lt;/thread-keepalive>
&lt;request-timeout>30&lt;/request-timeout>
&lt;live-time>20&lt;/live-time>
...
</example>

<p>In general, the request-timeout and keepalives are less important
for Resin standalone configurations than Apache/IIS/srun
configurations.  Very heavy traffic sites may want to reduce the
timeout for Resin standalone.</p>

<p>Since <var/request-timeout/> will close srun connections, its
setting needs to take into consideration the <var/live-time/> setting
for mod_caucho or isapi_srun.  <var/live-time/> is the time the
plugin will keep a connection open.  <var/request-timeout/> must
always be larger than <var/live-time/>, otherwise the plugin will try
to reuse a closed socket.</p>

</section>

<section title="Plugin keepalives (mod_caucho/isapi_srun)">

<p>The web server plugin, mod_caucho, needs configuration for its keepalive
handling because requests are handled differently in the web server.
Until the web server sends a request to Resin, it can't tell if Resin
has closed the other end of the socket.  If the JVM has restarted
or if closed the socket because of <var/request-timeout/>,
mod_caucho will not know about the closed socket.  So mod_caucho needs
to know how long to consider a connection reusable before closing it.
<var/live-time/> tells the plugin how long it should consider a
socket usable.</p>

<p>Because the plugin isn't signalled when Resin closes the socket,
the socket will remain half-closed until the next web server request.
A <var/netstat/> will show that as a bunch of sockets in the FIN_WAIT_2
state.  With Apache, there doesn't appear to be a good way around
this.  If these become a problem, you can increase
<var/request-timeout/> and <var/live-time/> so the JVM won't close the
keepalive connections as fast.</p>

<example>
unix> netstat
...
localhost.32823      localhost.6802       32768      0 32768      0 CLOSE_WAIT
localhost.6802       localhost.32823      32768      0 32768      0 FIN_WAIT_2
localhost.32824      localhost.6802       32768      0 32768      0 CLOSE_WAIT
localhost.6802       localhost.32824      32768      0 32768      0 FIN_WAIT_2
...
</example>

<section title="TCP limits (TIME_WAIT)">

<p>A client and a server that open a large number of TCP connections can
run into operating system/TCP limits.  If mod_caucho isn't configured
properly, it can use too many connections to Resin.  When the limit is
reached, mod_caucho will report "can't connect" errors until a timeout
is reached.  Load testing or benchmarking can run into the same
limits, causing apparent connection failures even though the Resin
process is running fine.</p>

<p>The TCP limit is the TIME_WAIT timeout.  When the TCP socket
closes, the side starting the close puts the socket into the TIME_WAIT
state.  A <var/netstat/> will short the sockets in the TIME_WAIT
state.  The following shows an example of the TIME_WAIT sockets
generated while benchmarking.  Each client connection has a unique
ephemeral port and the server always uses its public port:</p>

<example title='Typical Benchmarking Netstat'>
unix> netstat
...
tcp   0   0 localhost:25033  localhost:8080  TIME_WAIT   
tcp   0   0 localhost:25032  localhost:8080  TIME_WAIT   
tcp   0   0 localhost:25031  localhost:8080  TIME_WAIT   
tcp   0   0 localhost:25030  localhost:8080  TIME_WAIT   
tcp   0   0 localhost:25029  localhost:8080  TIME_WAIT   
tcp   0   0 localhost:25028  localhost:8080  TIME_WAIT
...
</example>

<p>The socket will remain in the TIME_WAIT state for a
system-dependent time, generally 120 seconds, but usually
configurable.  Since there are less than 32k ephemeral socket available to
the client, the client will eventually run out and start seeing
connection failures.  On some operating systems, including RedHat
Linux, the default limit is only 4k sockets.  The full 32k sockets
with a 120 second timeout limits the number of connections to about
250 connections per second.</p>

<p>If mod_caucho or isapi_srun are misconfigured, they can use too
many connections and run into the TIME_WAIT limits.  Using keepalives
effectively avoids this problem.  Since keepalive connections are
reused, they won't go into the TIME_WAIT state until they're finally
closed.  A site can maximize the keepalives by setting
<var/thread-keepalive/> large and setting <var/live-time/> and
<var/request-timeout/> to large values.  <var/thread-keepalive/> limits
the maximum number of keepalive connections.  <var/live-time/> and
<var/request-timeout/> will configure how long the connection will be
reused.</p>

<example title='Configuration for a medium-loaded Apache'>
...
&lt;thread-max>250&lt;/thread-max>
&lt;thread-keepalive>200&lt;/thread-keepalive>
&lt;request-timeout>120&lt;/request-timeout>
&lt;live-time>100&lt;/live-time>
...
</example>

<p><var/thread-max/> must always be larger than <var/thread-keepalive/>
and <var/request-timeout/> must always be larger than
<var/live-time/>.  In addition, <var/thread-keepalive/> should be larger
than the maximum number of Apache processes.</p>

</section>

<section title="Apache 1.3 issues">

<p>Using Apache as a web server on Unix introduces a number of issues because
Apache uses a process model instead of a threading model.  The Apache
processes don't share the keepalive srun connections.  Each process
has its own connection to Resin.  In contrast, IIS uses a threaded
model so it can share Resin connections between the threads.  The
Apache process model means Apache needs more connections to Resin than
a threaded model would.</p>

<p>In other words, the keepalive and TIME_WAIT issues mentioned above
are particularly important for Apache web servers.  It's a good idea
to use <var/netstat/> to check that a loaded Apache web server isn't
running out of keepalive connections and running into TIME_WAIT problems.</p>
