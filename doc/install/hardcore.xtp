    <description>
      <p>Resin HardCore (experimental) is a Linux kernel module.  By pulling the webserver
        into the kernel single-computer Resin servers and
        load-balanced servers can greatly improve their performance.
        HardCore replaces Apache as a web-server, grabbing HTTP
        requests and passing them to the backend Resin JVMs.  Because
        HardCore operates entirely in the kernel, it has very low
        overhead.</p>

<note>Resin HardCore is experimental.</note>


<section title="Basic Operation">

<p>Resin HardCore works much like the Apache/mod_caucho combination.  When a
new browser request appears on port 80, it accepts the request and
parses the HTTP header.  It then selects a JVM and forwards the request
to the backend servlet runner.  When the servlet runner responds, HardCore
will send the response to the browser.</p>

<p>Unlike Apache/mod_caucho, HardCore passes every request to the servlet
runner.  In essence, it's a kernel proxy.  Restricting HardCore to a proxy
tremendously simplifies the configuration and maintenance -- an important
consideration when writing a kernel application.</p>

<p>Because HardCore is entirely in kernel space, it can quickly forward
the requests without slow context switches or copying from user space.  Once
the load-balancing is complete, an Linux box can serve as a low cost
sticky-session load balancer with much better performance than an
Apache load balancer.</p>

</section>

<section title="Installation">

<p>The Resin ./configure script will select the Linux sources.  The
standard make; make install will put a <var/resin.o/> in
resin-2.0.x/libexec.  <var/resin.o/> is the actual kernel module.</p>

<p>For standard configurations, ./configure will find the source, but
you can change it with configure arguments (or in the Makefile).</p>

<deftable>
<tr><td>--with-linux-src=/usr/src/linux<td>Selects the kernel source
<tr><td>--enable-linux-smp<td>Compiles for an SMP system or not.
</deftable>

<p>Once you've got a resin.o in libexec, you can install it as a
module.  The Linux command is <var/insmod/>.</p>

<p>HardCore can take an optional argument, <var/port/>, to select the
server port.  It defaults to the standard HTTP port 80.</p>

<example>
unix> ./configure --with-linux-src=/usr/src/linux
...
unix> make
unix> make install
unix> su root
unix# /sbin/insmod libexec/resin.o port=81

...

unix# /sbin/rmmod resin
</example>

</section>

<section title="Configuration in /proc/net/resin">

<p>Once as a module, HardCore creates the <var//proc/net/resin/>
directory for configuration. It currently contains three files:
<var/server_port/> to configure the listening port, <var/srun-count/>
to specify the number of load balancing servlet-runners, and
<var/srun-n/> to configure each servlet runner.</p>

<deftable>
<tr><td>server_port<td>Configures the listening port, e.g. 80
(currently read-only)
<tr><td>srun-count<td>Configures how many servlet runners to use
<tr><td>srun-0<td>The IP and port for the first servlet runner
</deftable>

<p>You can look at those files to see their values:</p>

<example>
unix# ls /proc/net/resin
server_port srun-0 srun-count
unix# cat /proc/net/resin/server_port
80
unix# cat /proc/net/resin/srun-count
1
unix# cat /proc/net/resin/srun-0
127.0.0.1 6802
</example>

<p/>You can also configure <var/srun-0/> to change the servlet runner.

<example>
unix# echo "192.168.0.3 6810" > /proc/net/resin-srun-0
</example>

<section title="Caveats and Errata">

<p>Any bugs in HardCore will likely crash or freeze your computer.  In
theory it could also do bad things to the filesystem, although that
hasn't happened to us ... yet.  Working with kernel modules is not
as safe as a C program and nowhere near as safe as running a Java program.
</p>

<p>The 12/21 version handles basic GET requests.</p>

<p>The current errata:</p>
<ul>
<li>POST requests are not handled
<li>Date routines have not yet been implemented
<li>Load-balancing is not yet done
<li>Failure to contact a srun results in a disconnect instead of an
error message.
<li>/caucho-status isn't implemented yet.
<li>Caching isn't implemented yet.
<li>Logging isn't implemented yet.
<li>HTTP/1.1 keepalive isn't implemented.
</ul>
